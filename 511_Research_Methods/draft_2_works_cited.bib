	abstract = {Recent years have seen considerable advances in audio synthesis with deep generative models. However, the stateof-the-art is very difﬁcult to quantify; different studies often use different evaluation methodologies and different metrics when reporting results, making a direct comparison to other systems difﬁcult if not impossible. Furthermore, the perceptual relevance and meaning of the reported metrics in most cases unknown, prohibiting any conclusive insights with respect to practical usability and audio quality. This paper presents a study that investigates state-of-the-art approaches side-by-side with (i) a set of previously proposed objective metrics for audio reconstruction, and with (ii) a listening study. The results indicate that currently used objective metrics are insufﬁcient to describe the perceptual quality of current systems.},

	abstract = {Creativity can hardly be understood in isolation from a context where values such as novelty and usefulness are ascribed. This paper presents a multi-level perspective for the study of creativity and formulates a framework for computational creativity that consists of 1) Culture; 2) Society; 3) Groups; 4) Products; 5) Personality; 6) Cognition, 7) Neural processes; and 8) CC processes. This model enables the definition of functional relationships among these levels. As an initial step to illustrate its usefulness, an analysis is made of the ICCC’12 proceedings in view of this model.},

	title = {Computational and {Collective} {Creativity}: {Who}'s {Being} {Creative}? {Human} and {Computational} {Creativity}},
	shorttitle = {Computational and {Collective} {Creativity}},
	abstract = {Creativity research has traditionally focused on human crea-tivity, and even more specifically, on the psychology of in-dividual creative people. In contrast, computational creativ-ity research involves the development and evaluation of creativity in a computational system. As we study the effect of scaling up from the creativity of a computational system and individual people to large numbers of diverse computa-tional agents and people, we have a new perspective: crea-tivity can ascribed to a computational agent, an individual person, collectives of people and agents and/or their interac-tion. By asking "Who is being creative?" this paper exam-ines the source of creativity in computational and collective creativity. A framework based on ideation and interaction provides a way of characterizing existing research in com-putational and collective creativity and identifying direc-tions for future research.},
