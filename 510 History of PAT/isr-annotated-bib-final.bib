	abstract = {Reproducing piano rolls are among the early music storage mediums, preserving ﬁne details of a piano or organ performance on a continuous roll of paper with holes punched onto them. While early acoustic recordings suffer from poor quality sound, reproducing piano rolls beneﬁt from the ﬁdelity of a live piano for playback, and capture all features of a performance in what amounts to an early digital data format. However, due to limited availability of well maintained playback instruments and the condition of fragile paper, rolls have remained elusive and generally inaccessible for study. This paper proposes methods for modeling and digitizing reproducing piano rolls. Starting with an optical scan, we convert the raw image data into the MIDI ﬁle format by applying histogram-based image processing and building computational models of the musical expressions encoded on the rolls. Our evaluations show that MIDI emulations from our computational models are accurate on note level and proximate the musical expressions when compared with original playback recordings.},

	abstract = {The thesis exhibition, Musica Universalis, is a multi-sensory exhibition comprised of experimental weavings on deconstructed found pianos, systematic drawings, and paper scroll music boxes. The music boxes allow the viewer to hear the voice part represented on the weaving, or the notes of a systematic drawing, in isolation; a recording of a choral composition transcribed from the first systematic drawing of circles plays from the gallery speakers. The viewer can hear the individual’s “song” and simultaneously hear the collective performance. The performance of the collective music box composition varies depending on the level of viewer engagement.
I create system-based abstractions drawing from my understanding of structure within music and weaving, as well as analog and digital technologies, to achieve a purer abstraction. For the purposes of this paper, I define abstraction as artwork that reshapes the natural world for expressive purposes, interpreting expressive as relating to intuition, emotions and the subconscious. Therefore, I characterize pure abstraction as work that directly resonates within the viewer’s soul or subconscious, having meaning that reaches beyond what is visible. I look to Wassily Kandinsky’s Compositions and Paul Klee’s Rhythmisches as case studies for the pursuit of pure abstraction, in which they drew from the formal qualities and conventions of Western music aesthetics to inform their visual abstractions. My response to their projects is to present work in which the visual and aural elements are of equal importance. This thesis briefly visits the projects of Kandinsky and Klee as they influenced the development of the immersive exhibition and documents the many facets to the viewer’s experience within Musica Universalis.},

	abstract = {Reproducing piano rolls have been of great interest to me for nearly 40 years, yet despite their significant potential in a number of research areas, they remain largely untapped. In my thesis I seek to discover why this vast historical library of music and interpretations is not more widely acknowledged and utilised. Reproducing piano rolls provide a valuable evidence of nineteenth-century performing practices, as well as offering unique pathways to other forms of research. The substantive catalogues of art music alone prove the musical worth of these rolls. Numerous commentators have chosen either to ignore or to consciously dismiss reproducing piano roll recordings as a valid representation of the art of the pianist. Clearly, in the majority of cases, their opinions have been formed through hearing rolls replayed on poorly adjusted instruments; the piano rolls themselves are not the problem. To dispel the myths that have taken hold as a result, I examine how three major piano roll companies made their recordings, and test the common criticism that these recordings were subjected to invasive editorial change. Accessing faithful piano roll recordings is an acknowledged problem. My viewpoint is that if piano roll recordings are made as accessible as early sound recordings, many rich research opportunities will present themselves. Archiving piano rolls remains an area desperately in need of further research. In this thesis I present the philosophy underpinning my methodology for developing the means to record piano rolls as raw MIDI files. Making the raw files compatible with contemporary MIDI instruments provides the sought-after accessibility, a topic that has so far attracted minimal academic interest.},

To investigate this issue further we have conducted an analysis on a fascinating piece of machinery often referred to as one of the predecessors of the modern day computer, the Jacquard loom. In analysing the Jacquard loom we look at qualities in design and interaction from some different perspectives: how historical tools, crafts, and practices can inform interaction design, the role of physicality, materiality, and full-body interaction in order to rethink some current conceptions of interaction and design of computational devices.},
